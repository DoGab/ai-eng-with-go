# AI Engineering with Go

This repository contains the course materials for **AI Engineering with Go**, a hands-on course where I build a real project while teaching AI/LLM concepts using Go.

ðŸŽ¥ **Course Link:** https://www.bytesizego.com/courses/ai-engineering-with-go

## What's Inside

- **`examples/`** - Small applications demonstrating core LLM concepts with simple, focused examples
- **`flashcards/`** - The main project backend built throughout the course 
- **`flashcards-app/`** - React frontend for the flashcards project
- **`prjstart/`** - Go API template for starting your own backend projects

## Course Structure

The repository uses **branches as checkpoints** - at the end of most modules, I create a branch so you can access the materials at that specific point in the course.

The course includes video recordings of the entire development process, from concept explanation to implementation.
